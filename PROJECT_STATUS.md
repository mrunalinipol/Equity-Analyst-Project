# Project Status and Session Handoff

Last updated: 2026-10-28

Read this file at the start of the next session. It records the verified project state. Do not put API keys or other secret values in this file.

## Repository

- Local folder: `/Users/mrunalinipol/Documents/Codex/2026-10-22/hel`
- Public GitHub repository: <https://github.com/mrunalinipol/Equity-Analyst-Project>
- Branch: `main`
- Student: Mrunalini Pol
- Purdue email: `pol0@purdue.edu`
- Lab partner: Shachi Kaushik

## Secret status

- `.env` exists locally and is ignored by Git.
- `.env` contains `SEC_USER_AGENT` and a Purdue GenAI Studio API key.
- Do not print, quote, commit, or upload the API key.
- The previously exposed key was replaced directly in `.env` on 2026-10-28.
- The public GitHub URL for `.env` returned HTTP 404 during the last verification.

## Completed work

### Lab 01

- `hello.md` exists.
- `AGENTS.md` contains the required explanation instruction.
- `check_env.py` reads `.env` and prints only the first four API-key characters followed by `...`, plus `SEC_USER_AGENT`.
- `.gitignore` excludes `.env`, `.env.*`, `.emv`, `.venv/`, Python cache files, and local application downloads.
- The repository is public and was verified without `.env`.
- The Session 1 Brightspace checkout was previously submitted.

### Week 2 pre-work

- Reading answers and the Costco filing check are in `WEEK2_PREWORK.md`.
- The paper-tool answer identifies EDGAR as the free filings reader.
- Figure 1 is identified as a workflow because code fixes its roles, hand-offs, checks, and revision path.
- The autonomy-slider answer and the unseen-company earnings-prediction limitation are recorded.
- Costco's 2026 10-K check matched net income of $9,226 million and diluted EPS of $20.76 to the XBRL facts for 2026-08-30.

### Lab 02

- `desk.py` implements the seven required data-desk steps without a hard-coded company.
- Required arguments: positional ticker.
- Optional arguments: `--peers`, `--price`, and `--step`.
- The program reads `SEC_USER_AGENT` from `.env` and sends it on SEC requests.
- The program selects the latest 10-K, 10-Q, and Item 2.02 8-K.
- The program saves the filing texts, Exhibit 99.1, facts, ratios, release evidence, peer data, and source metadata.
- Candidate XBRL tags are selected by the newest available fiscal year.
- All main-company facts use the 10-K fiscal-year end selected for revenue.
- Ratio arithmetic is calculated in code and printed.
- `Total revenue`, `Total revenues`, and Apple's `Total net sales` release labels are supported.
- The full audit is in `LAB02_VALIDATION.md`.

Verified Walmart portability run:

- Folder: `outputs/WMT_20261027_092443`
- 10-K fiscal-year end: 2026-01-31
- Total revenue: $713.163 billion
- Operating income: $29.825 billion
- Operating margin: 4.1821%

Validation state:

- Python version: 3.13.15.
- Five automated tests pass.
- `python -m compileall` passes.
- `git diff --check` passes.
- A public GitHub check returned HTTP 200 for the code, validation file, and Costco facts.
- A public GitHub check returned HTTP 404 for `.env`.
- Live run evidence was verified with partner Shachi Kaushik, and partner initials were obtained.
- The two-minute explanation was completed in person.
- The closing price was verified.

### Saved course material

- `papers/FRL-CanAIReplaceAnalyst.pdf` is the 9-page paper titled “Can AI match professional analysts? Evidence from a multi-agent system.”
- The uploaded PDF checksum matched the copy in Downloads.
- `library/lab02_equity_research_desk_prompt.md` contains the reconstructed Lab 02 prompt written approximately 80% toward ASD-STE100.

### Lab 03 — completed in the app

- Purdue GenAI Studio is configured through the official OpenAI Python SDK.
- The local `.env` defines `BASE_URL` and `MODEL` in addition to the secret key and SEC User-Agent.
- The live provider test succeeded with `llama3.1:latest`.
- `desk.py` runs four model roles after the seven data steps: Research Analyst, Financial Analyst, Investment Advisor, and Strategy Manager.
- Each role receives a JSON object with its task, allowed context, and expected output.
- The Financial Analyst receives a calculator-built block and must not recalculate it.
- The harness permits one revision when a Financial Analyst draft changes or omits a verified value.
- The harness rejects a Strategy Manager compilation that omits the five parts, the verified values, a research citation, or a sourced deciding number.
- The verified Costco report is `outputs/COST_20261028_194706/report.md`.
- The report uses Costco's 2026-10-27 close of $992.13 and reports P/E of 47.7905x.
- The report states all eleven core claims with filing accessions, XBRL tags or Exhibit 99.1 lines, periods, definitions, and arithmetic.
- Raw role outputs and Manager checks are in `outputs/COST_20261028_194706/role_outputs.json`.
- The blank human audit is `audits/COST_20261028_human_audit.md`. Its marks are intentionally blank.
- `LAB03_NOTES.md` records the observed Financial Analyst error and the human-sign-off reading.

Apple assignment run:

- Command: `.venv/bin/python desk.py AAPL --peers MSFT,GOOGL,DELL --price 338.19`.
- Saved folder: `outputs/AAPL_20261028_202525`.
- Fiscal 2025 total net sales: $416.161 billion.
- Operating income: $133.050 billion.
- Operating margin: 31.9708%.
- Latest-quarter total net sales: $109.417 billion.
- Latest-quarter diluted EPS: $2.02.
- Price: $338.19, the unadjusted July 29, 2026 close.
- P/E: 45.3338x.
- Peers: MSFT, GOOGL, and DELL.
- The Purdue model endpoint timed out twice. The saved report is explicitly
  labeled `fallback`, which the Lab 03 instructions permit when the provider is down.
- Apple report: `outputs/AAPL_20261028_202525/report.md`.
- Apple human-audit worksheet: `audits/AAPL_20261028_human_audit.md`.

## Main commands

Create the environment and install packages:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Costco:

```bash
.venv/bin/python desk.py COST --peers WMT,TGT,BJ --price 904.70
```

Run Walmart:

```bash
.venv/bin/python desk.py WMT --peers COST,TGT,BJ
```

Run one step:

```bash
.venv/bin/python desk.py COST --step 4

.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Remaining actions

1. Mrunalini must audit the Apple report by hand and fill `audits/AAPL_20261028_human_audit.md`. AI must not supply the marks.
2. Shachi Kaushik must check two Apple core claims and write both marks at the top of the audit file.
3. Mrunalini must audit all eleven Apple claims before Session 4.
4. The Apple report and code must be committed and pushed.
5. Submit the final commit permalink in Brightspace Checkpoint 1.

## Working rules for the next session

- Keep company-specific known answers in tests and saved evidence. Do not hard-code a company in `desk.py`.
- Keep every financial number tied to a filing line or to an XBRL tag, period, and accession.
- Use the same definition across peer comparisons.
- Do not claim that partner checks or in-person work are complete unless the student confirms them.
- Update this file before the next session ends.
